### Deep learning based model for real-time image processing with high-efficiency (90%+)

Thrust of the project is to highlight the practical treatment of ASPERGER‘s SYNDROME through emotion detection (emotion detection real-time using videos) application and neural network's with improving efficiency of image.

### Implementation abstract:

Our main aim is to detect emotion of the person using our application whether person is crying, laughing etc. So with this thought we proposed a creation of an application that has following features: Face Detection: To detect the face of person, so that training of image of face can be done for further processes. Face Recognition: To recognize the face with the help of previous stored data, this will help the patient to keep on interacting with the people around him. Emotion Detection: To detect different emotion of human beings and provide the output describing the details of that emotion. Side by side we are denoising image using Gaussian method for Gaussian noise and NLM method for impulsive noise. This lead to improve efficiency of image and we get better results. Every data update dynamically at each test case to improve efficiency with each test case.

## Getting started

-   Please follow along with the documentation provided inside the repository for complete guide for getting started.

## Usage

1: The thrust of this project is to highlight the practical treatment of Asperger’s Syndrome through emotion detection application. We have proposed an implementation for its treatment through an android application. Through our proposed application, any child with this disorder can learn about different emotion practically by detecting the emotion of a person, they are not able to comprehend.

2: We have studied the problem associated in the treatment of Asperger Syndrome and came to know that affect person is not able to comprehend the emotions. So we came out with an application that detect emotions and tries to improve the social skills of affected child. We have used some computer vision libraries like opencv, face++ for the implementation of this application.
